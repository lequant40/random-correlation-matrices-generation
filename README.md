# Description

Random correlation matrices can be generated using an algorithm due to Pourahmadi and Wang [1] based on the hyperspherical parametrization.

This algorithm relies internally on a procedure to generate random samples from a specific probability density, for which Makalic and Schmidt [2] initially proposed an efficient rejection sampling algorithm.

Later, Opdyke [3] introduced an inverse method sampling algorithm for this probability density, improving the performances of the Makalic and Schmidt's algorithm.

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook comparing the practical performances of these two sampling algorithms.
